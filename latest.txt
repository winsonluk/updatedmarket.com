Stocks rise; Treasuries steady. U.S. stocks edged higher in choppy trading on Friday as market participants weighed Thursday’s inflation report and looked toward next week's Federal Reserve policy decision. The Dow added 13 points, paring its weekly decline to 0.8%. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to a fresh record level, ending the week slightly higher (+0.4%). The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, capping its fourth consecutive weekly gain (+1.9%), its longest such stretch since the start of this year. Treasuries weakened modestly, with the yield on the 10-year note up one basis point to 1.45%, rising for the first time in four days. Still, the benchmark rate hovered near its lowest level since early March, posting its biggest weekly drop in a year (-11 basis points). On the data front, a preliminary gauge from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment improving more than expected in June. The release also revealed an unexpected decline in consumers’ inflationary expectations over the next 12 months. In commodities, WTI crude added 0.7% to $70.79/barrel.

In earnings, Dave & Buster's lost 2.7% despite posting a surprise profit tally, while Chewy declined 5.8% as a warning about supply chain issues and labor shortages overshadowed otherwise upbeat quarterly figures.
